# UI_Builder
Configurable UI Platform

This is still WIP. The project aims to create a custom UI using AngularJS and a JSON config file. This will have a responsive design with responsive left and right sidebar for more features. The filters on the sidebar will be tied in with the numeric grid. 

The project aims to create a filter system to filter the number grid and display stats on a leaflet map. Changes to the config file will actually show up in the view. This also aims to create a way for developers to access data in their specific controller easily.
